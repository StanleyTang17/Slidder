(i) Features of my program
-2D platformer meets sliding puzzle
-double jump(one on the ground and one in the air)
-items you can pick up
-original graphics
-sound effects
-the ability to create and edit your own levels
-import custom-made levels(the program saves what level you previously imported)
-complete access to all game files except the source code, so feel free to mess around with them or just completely destroy the game

differences between the original plan: didn't have time to make lasers, saw, and launchpad.

(ii) Known bugs
-zoomed view will sometimes glitch left and right if the level is too small
-if the player is within the sight of a turret at the start, the turret will immediately shoot when the player respawns
-this is not a bug, but a common illusion: when you jump at the edge of a platform, you'll sometimes find that you can't double jump in the air. What actually happened was you were just slightly off the edge of the platform when you jumped, so you actually jumped in the air, which uses up your double jump.

(iii) Special instructions
-no cheats so far
-make sure to turn volume to max and wear headphones when playing

(iv) Improvements if I have time
-fix the bugs
-add more game objects
-add background music
-make more levels

(v) I'm solo

(vi) Comments
Writing the documentation and internal comments SEVERELY limited my creativity, unlike in grade 11 when I could just go wild with the game, but it did force me to make my code more organized. With all due respect, I did enjoy making this game. I can't really pick a best part of the process because every step was fulfilling: getting the game to work(especially the graphics), creating levels, playing my own levels, etc. The worst part I've already mentioned in the first sentence. The "platformer meets slidding puzzle" idea wasn't my own, it was from a web minigame I played god knows how many years ago. I wasn't able to find that web game anymore so I took the idea from memory and made my own version of it; you can call this a "ghost" of that game. Needless to say, I took some stuff from my last game to build this one, such as the GameObject and JFrame code, the class architecture design, some graphics, and some sound effects.
